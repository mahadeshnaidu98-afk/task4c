You are tasked with creating a Python program that showcases operations on dictionaries. Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of items.  Each item is a pair consisting of a key and a value. Your program should illustrate the following dictionary operations:
dictionary={'name':'alice','age':30,'city':'new york'}
print(dictionary)
print(dictionary['name'])
print(dictionary['age'])
dictionary['name']="james"
print(dictionary)
dictionary.pop('city')
print(dictionary)
for k in dictionary:
 print("KEY:",k)
print(dictionary.items())
